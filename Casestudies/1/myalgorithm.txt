Histogram 
Case Study 1  - Algorithm
----------------------------------
Step 1:  Start
Step 2:  Create an object infile of ifstream class
Step 3:  Initialize wordcount,sentence count, and 
   	 other integer variables
Step 4:  Declare a character variable and sentence length array.
Step 5:  Read the filename from the user and store it in a string variable.
Step 6:  Open the file using open() member function.
Step 7:  Use if statement to check if the file exist or not, if not then 
   	 return a string promting the user to enter a valid filename.
Step 8:  Else go to step 8.
Step 9:  Read all data of file object inside a while loop.
Step 10: After each read, check for end-of-file using the eof() member function.
Step 11: Check for ' ','\n' and '.' characters using if construct.
Step 12: If ' ' is found increment wordcount, Else go to step 11.
Step 13: If '\n' is found reset wordcount, Else go to step 12.
Step 14: If '.' is found then increment the wordcount and store it in an array.
Step 15: Increment sentence count and reset word count.
Step 16: End the while loop.
Step 17: Use two for loops to print histogram.
Step 18: Close the file using close() member function.
Step 19: Stop.
